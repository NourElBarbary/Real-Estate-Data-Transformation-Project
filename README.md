# Real Estate Data Transformation Project

Welcome to the **Real Estate Data Transformation Project** â€“ a robust data engineering solution designed to transform raw, inconsistent real estate listings into **clean, standardised, and business-ready datasets** using the **Medallion Architecture**.

---

## Project Overview

Real estate data is often messy: unstructured text, inconsistent formats, currency issues, duplicates, and missing values can make analysis impossible. This project builds a **powerful end-to-end data transformation pipeline** that solves these challenges by:
- Cleaning and standardising real estate listings.
- Structuring property features for powerful analytics.
- Enabling accurate market insights and buyer-friendly dashboards.

## Architecture: Medallion Layers

We leverage the **Medallion Architecture** to progressively refine the data:

### Bronze Layer: Raw Data
- Stores unprocessed listings from multiple sources.
- Handles inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values.
- Raw data saved as `bronze_layer_real_estate.parquet`.

### Silver Layer: Cleaned & Enriched Data
- Standardises currencies, areas, and categorical features.
- Imputes missing values intelligently using multi-column context.
- Prepares data for complex business transformations.

### Gold Layer: Business-Optimised Data
- Adds unique property IDs, location extraction, and property types (BHK, Villas, Apartments).
- Computes key features like `price_per_sqft` and `price_per_sqft_category` (Budget, Mid-Range, Luxury).
- Fully optimised for dashboards, search, filtering, and business analytics.
